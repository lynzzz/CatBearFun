1. I am a software engineer currently with Siemens, 
2. my primary job responsibility is backend development, feature implementation and workflow creation.
3. My tech stack is Java and C++
4. Cumulatively, I have 6 years experience and I am looking for a backend position. 








What Elekta does is Elekta delivers oncology software treating cancer and brain disorder. In high level, it does three things, 
1. Read the CT image into our software, and display it three diemsnions, trasverse, sagittal and coronal.
2. It provides contouring feature that allows user to draw the contour of organ and contour of tumor. We also provide a machine learning algo that draws the contour of organ automoatically.
3. Based on contour of tumor, the system calculate how much does is needed to kill the tumor and pass this information to hardware machine, which delivers the dose to patient.

I was with Elekta for three years, I touched frontEnd, backend, algorithm layer, infrastructure layer, persistence layer, unit test layer, pretty much everthing a little bit.
