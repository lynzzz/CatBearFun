knowledge summary
1. SQL vs NOSQL https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2yDVZnQ8lG need authentication
  a. storage model
      SQL is relational DB whereas NOSQL is nonrelational DB.
      NOSQL has different storage model:
      1: key value:    Radis, Memcached
      2: document:     MongoDB
      3: Wide Column:  Cassandra
      4: Graph DB:

  b. key difference
                                 SQL                                          NOSQL
  schema                         Yes                                           NO
  scale(sharding, replication)   Manually(challenging time consuming)       Automatica (cheap)
  ACID compliant                 Better

  In general, NOSQL db sacrifices ACID compliance for scalability and high speed.

  c. When SQL is prefered

     c1. The case you need to use SQL: Need to have ACID compliance. Transaction, for example bank.
     c2. You data is structurd and unchanged.

  d. When to NOSQL is preferred
     d1. Store large data that has no structure.
     d2. you want software scale the data for you.
     d3. fast development.

  e. Cassandra or key-value stores in general, always maintain a certain number of replicas to offer reliability
