UW MBA program:
1. Time
   a. 3 years/70 credites
   b. Go to school once a week, 6pm - 9:30
   c. Spend one day on the weekend on homework.

2. Money 84000$, twice the price of full time MBA resident tuition

3. Network: People can only give you opportunity source, after-class club. You got the offer by your qualification

4. protential Job:
   Amazon Program Manager:
   pros: not writing code, Email, presentation, document.
   cons: job security low.
   Challenging: Drive developers to deliver and launch without merit power.

5. Getting business sense:
   Accouting, finance, ecomomics, marketing, supply chain.

6. From my standpoint:
   1. Too much time commitment to do 3 yrs MBA
   2. I can try to transfer to PM role without MBA inside MS, better transition with Management and half tech.
