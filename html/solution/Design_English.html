1. How do we handle file transfer efficiently?
   Break down the file into small chunks and only transfer chunks that modified, not the whole file. Each chunk size is 4MB, and chunk size can be
   changed based on cloud storage and bandwidth.

2. How can clients efficiently listen to changes happening with other clients?
   long poll.
   Long poll definition: This is a variation of the traditional polling technique that allows the server to push information to a client whenever the data is available.
                         With Long-Polling, the client requests information from the server exactly as in normal polling, but with the expectation that the server may not respond immediately.


   Client componet:
   a. internal metadata service.
   b. chunker
   c. Viewer
   d. controller



3. How should clients handle slow servers?
   Clients should exponentially back-off if the server is busy/not-responding. Meaning, if a server is too slow to respond, clients should delay their retries and this delay should increase exponentially.


4. Should mobile clients sync remote changes immediately?
   Unlike desktop or web clients, mobile clients usually sync on demand to save userâ€™s bandwidth and space.
