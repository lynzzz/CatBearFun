TrieNode{
  TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26];
  String[] words;
  getter(char c){ return children[c - 'a']}
  setter(char c){children[c-'a'] = new TrieNode()}
  contains(char c) return children[c-'a'] != null
}

1. How to store complete terms
Each node stores 10 top terms.

2. How do we build this trie with 10 frequently serched terms.
Build it offline, Recursion, divide and conquer, bottom up. parent asks child,
what is your top sugeestion with count, and child does the same to its child,
all the way from root to leaf node, and then conquer, parent node combine the result and
store the top 10 results, all the way up.
