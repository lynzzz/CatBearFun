</code></pre>
1. Definition: In general, a rate limiter caps how many requests a sender can issue in a specific time window. It then blocks requests once the cap is reached.
2. Usage: control traffic, avoid robot machine abuse, security(password brutal force trial)
3. Requirement:
   Functional: 1. limit number of requests in a time Windows      2. rate limit across multipe servers.
   Nonfunctrional: 1. highly available, 2. low latency
4. Algo
   Fixed window:       User : {count, timestamp}  maintain 1 for 1 user
   Sliding window:     User : HashSet<Timestamp>  maintain 1 for 1 user

5. Storage estimation
   limit 500 requests per hour for 1M user
   Fixed window:    user : 8byte, count 4byte, time stamp 4 byte, Hashtable overhead 20 byte.  (8 + 4 + 4 +20)* 1M = 36MB
   sliding window:  user : 8byte, time stamp 4 byte, 20 byte for hashset overhead, 20 byte for hash table overhead  (8 + (4 + 20)*500 + 20)*1M =  12GB


Design from scratch 4/16/2020
Requirement: allow 3 requests within one minute.

Before looking at solution:
My naive thinking is to maintain a vector of class, where each class contains {userName, timeStamp}
{ {u1, t1}, {u2, t2}, { u3, t3} }

Algorithm: When one request comes
step 1: delete all entries earlier than t1-60.
step 2: check how many entries left within [t1-60, t1] time frame, if less than
        3, add the new entry allow the request. if there is alreay 3 entries already,
        delete all three entries for this user, then add [u1, t4] in and disallow the request.

drawback: you will need to add entries in and then remove entries out, which results in high latency
          and more memory usage.


Solution I: Fixed window solution
每过60秒就重新计数

数据结构只维持一个entry, name-> {count, oldest Time}

class Node{
  int count;
  timestamp time;
}
data structure: HashMap&lt;String, Node> m = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

Algorithm:
If the ‘UserID’ is not present in the hash-table, insert it, set the ‘Count’ to 1, set ‘StartTime’ to the current time (normalized to a minute), and allow the request.

Otherwise, find the record of the ‘UserID’ and if CurrentTime – StartTime >= 1 min, set the ‘StartTime’ to the current time, ‘Count’ to 1, and allow the request.

If CurrentTime - StartTime <= 1 min and

If ‘Count < 3’, increment the Count and allow the request.
If ‘Count >= 3’, reject the request.


sudo code:

     if (Name not find ){
       m.put(name, new Node(1, curTimeStamp));
       allow request
     }else{

       if ( curTimeStamp - m.get(name).time) > 1min{
           m.get(name).count = 1;
           m.get(name).time = curTimeStamp;
           // allow request
       }else{
         if ( m.get(name).count < 3){
           count++;
           // allow request
         }else{
           // disallow request
         }
       }
     }

drawback:

 |           ***|  |***           |
 t1             t2 t3            t4

t2-1 发三个， t3+1发三个
[t1, t2] 60s间只有3个，合理
[t3, t4] 60s间只有3个  合理

但是很明显 [t2-1, t3-1]间没有60s,但是有6个request,违反了1分钟内只能发三个的规定

Storage：
userName: 8 byte
count： 2 byte： 2^16 = 65k, meet the needs
TimeStamp: 4 bytes

* hashtable overhead per record: 20 bytes
* lock per record to avoid racecondition: 4byte

8 + 2 +4 + 20 + 4 = 38 bytes
say you have 1m user, total memory is = 38MB. where one server can satisfy.
We need to put it in high performance cache DB such a memcached or casandra
