Load balancing: ?
Redrection between cache servers


Cache:
Metadata will be saved in cache database, such as MemcacheD or Redis.
This is dedicated cache service, all backend machine will hit it.

Database is large, we cannot save all entries in Cache, so we must have
eviction policy? LRU is popular Eviction policy.



CDN:
store popular video, that is saved in different geographic locations.
request will be routed to CDN that is close to user. Less popular data
will be read from backend Distributed file system.
