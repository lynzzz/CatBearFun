        1. 答题思路 (STAR） Situation, task, action, result.


        例子
        https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ema_Wd_Du5AL1nTVLF7WVdFzCIZuOWR7U7B2cnnZvNE/edit


        1. unclear responsibility
        2. 做一件本不该你做的事情： 
           Google doc example 1:
          
        
        
        3. proudest project.
           Google doc example 3:

        4. Disagree with someone最后别人改了.
           Google doc example 4:



        5. Disagree 最后你改了
           

        6. 答应别人但没做的人
        
        9.一个项目在deadline里面没有做完，如何解决的。 你是如何知道做不完的，谁决定的 ： 
           这个题目的三个点是 1. notify manager immediately 2. Bring up the reason why you can't finish on time 3. Trade off(可以做些其他简单的东西）
           Follow up 问题可能是，最后学到了什么?  Plan的时候要think of big picture.
        
           I would notify my manager immediately and tell my manager why I can't finish on time. Normally the reason is we just realized we need to implement an unplaned module/dependency that 
           takes additional time.  I would also ask instead getting this in, can I get a small feature in? And I would recall the design meeting, why we didn't take this dependency into
           consideration, to learn from past help us perform better in the future.
        
        10.一个项目在deadline里做完了。
        
        
        11. Conflict with coworker. 
            [这个例子要稍微加工以下] 
            自己做的项目，对别的组的code有一点dependency, 发邮件问能不能改一下library, 不会邮件，礼貌的问了说是自己有deadline to meet, 没有时间做我的。 解决方法是问他能不能一起去问manager, 
            然后我解释给manager听，说我的deadline要到了，需要他修改一点代码。 老板想了下决定把他的一些活给了另外一个人，让他有时间做这个事情。 最后我在deadline之内完成了这个项目。
            
        
        12. 如果有多项紧急的任务同时给你，你会如何处理？
            Prioritize task by following criteria
            How ergent this task is? 
            How hard it is/How much time it takes? ETA
            Does it need cooperration between mutilpe person/team? dependency
        
        

        Oracle BQ: 
        Project + BQ 如果你花了很多努力做出来了一个东西但是并没有得到很多的认可 你要怎么调节自己的情绪 (30min)
        Project + BQ 遇到过什么困难 怎么解决 学到了什么
        Project + BQ HM


                                     
                                     
                                     
        往模板里面套：
        1.Why do you want to leave MS?                             
          a. 肯定原公司      Microsoft is a great company. I have learned a lot and grown a lot working for Microsoft.
          b. 话风转到现公司： Oracle is also a great company, escpecially OCI, leveraging cutting edge
                            technolog and doing cloud business that I am very interested in. 
                            This is the place where i can grow and make impact.                           
         
          c. 小心陷阱        Follow up? Do you think you cannot have career growth in Microsoft?
                            I can have career growth in MS, but I am more interested in Oracle. 不要说career growth慢,更不要暗示politics. 这可能是red flag.
                            
                                     
                                     
        2. Why are you interested in this position?
          a. 对职位的了解：   This position is with OCI deployment team, that requires distributed system experience.
          b. qualificaiton:  And I have gained those experience from Microsoft Bing Ads and O365. Online service, large scale, high availability, low latency.                           
                             Thoses experience can help me onboard quicly and smoothly.
          c. career goal:  I would like to keep working on distributed system, and this position aligns with my career goal.                           
             

        3. Weakness:
          a. sometimes, I don't make the best decision when handling multi-tasking.
